### ESP32 WiFi Repeater

The **ESP32 WiFi Repeater** allows you to extend the range of an existing WiFi network. It connects to a primary WiFi source as a client and simultaneously acts as an access point, creating a new WiFi network for your devices to join. This effectively rebroadcasts the original WiFi signal, boosting coverage in areas with weak connectivity.

**Key features:**
- Acts as both a client (station mode) and an access point (soft AP mode).
- Ideal for improving WiFi signal coverage in larger areas.
- Supports dynamic IP assignment and can handle multiple devices connecting to the repeater network.
